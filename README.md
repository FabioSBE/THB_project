## Bash History Study Project

This project is a tool for **collecting**, **analyzing** and **searching** through your Bash history in Ubuntu 22.04. 
The goal is to identify frequently used commands and save results for further study. 
Currently in early stages of development, contributions and suggestions are welcome.

### Steps to use:
1. Export your Bash history by running the command `history > ./path/to/project/inputs/your_history_file.txt` in the terminal. 
**Note:** Be sure to change the file name every time you export a new history.
2. Run the script by navigating to the root folder of the project and running `python main.py`
3. The compilation of all commands will be exported to the `./path/to/project/commands/All.txt` file
4. The saved files will be exported to the `./path/to/project/outputs` folder
5. Use the menu options to analyze and search through your history.

### Enjoy analyzing your Bash history and optimizing your command line usage!

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
